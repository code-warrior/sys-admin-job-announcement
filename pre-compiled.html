        <ul>
          <li>Practice semi-agile methodologies via weekly scrum meetings</li>
          <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
          <li>Install or upgrade hardware in classrooms, server rooms, and faculty/staff spaces</li>

        <p>Upon graduation, you will have gained real-world, hands-on experience working on live systems in a team atmosphere.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: This role has the potential to be very physical. For example, heavy, 30-lb servers need to be shuffled around inside a 7-ft server rack. From time to time, you will have to replace classroom computers by crawling into awkward physical situations, such as crouching under a desk in a classroom.</p>
